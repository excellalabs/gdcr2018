## What is Nova Code and Coffee?

[NoVA Code & Coffee](http://novacodecoffee.com/) is an informal get together to write some code in the morning. Saturday Morning to be Exact. We're going with saturday mornings because weekdays and evenings are full enough as it is. Why add to the chaos of user groups, soccer games, and lawn mowing? There are no requirements other than the willingness to sit down, pair up, and learn something new.

## What is the Global Day of Code Retreat?

Coderetreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of 'getting things done', the coderetreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. Practicing the basic principles of modular and object-oriented design, developers can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the cost of change over time.

See [the Code Retreat](https://www.coderetreat.org/pages/about/) web site for more information.

### What are your favorite vs code extensions?
(Sean's response)

* Firstly, if you haven’t already, check out https://vscodecandothat.com/ -- a great resource for tips & tricks.
* I use an extension to watch remote files sometimes when I need to: https://seankilleen.com/2018/08/vscode-tip-watch-files/
* VS Live Share – this is awesome, allows you to live code with one or more people remotely. Super for remote pairing / mobbing.
* Docker: great extension; lets me easily see in a sidebar what containers are running, lets me quickly open a shell into them, etc.
* GitLens: great UI integration of various pieces of git information
* Azure Account: common sign-in / subscription management
* Beautify: beautify code in place for VS Code
* Npm intellisense

The rest is some of the basics for support / linting / highlighting  for various languages: 

* C#
* Cypher Query Language
* ESLint
* Ionide-fsharp
* Markdownlint
* PowerShell
* Python
* Ruby
* SQL Server
* TSLint
* Vetur
