# Welcome to Global Day of CodeRetreat!
Washington, DC Edition – Hosted at Excella’s Arlington Tech Exchange

##What is Nova Code and Coffee

NoVA Code & Coffee is an informal get together to write some code in the morning. Saturday Morning to be Exact. We're going with saturday mornings because weekdays and evenings are full enough as it is. Why add to the chaos of user groups, soccer games, and lawn mowing? There are no requirements other than the willingness to sit down, pair up, and learn something new.

## What is the Global Day of Code Retreat

Coderetreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of 'getting things done', the coderetreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. Practicing the basic principles of modular and object-oriented design, developers can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the cost of change over time.
